# CST383 Data Science

## Introduction 

### Why was the project undertaken
_According to the CDC, about 655,000 Americans die from heart disease: which is one in every 4 American's die from heart disease. This is one person every 36 seconds. By understanding the features that affect the disease, it is important_

### What was the research question, the tested hypotheseis or purpose of the research? 
_We hypothesized that age, high blood pressure, and sex were some of the leading factors for cardiovascular disease.  We tested this hypotheses and found that there were other factors unknown to us that contributed highly to the probability of dying from cardiovascular disease._ 

### Selection of Data 
_What is the source of the dataset? Characteristics of data?
Any munging or feature engineering?_

_The source of the dataset was from the University of California, Irvine - which used clinical records of heart failure. The characteristics of the data included various features relating to heart disease._

### Methods
_What materials/APIs/tools were used or who was included in answering the research question?_

### Results
_What answer was found to the research question; what did the study find? Was the tested hypothesis true? Any visualizations?_ 

_We found that there was a strong correlation between dying of cardiovascular disease with high blood pressure, serum creatine, ejection fraction, and serum sodium._ 

### Discussion
_What might the answer imply and why does it matter? How does it fit in with what other researchers have found? What are the perspectives for future research? Survey about the tools investigated for this assignment._

### Summary
_Most important findings._
